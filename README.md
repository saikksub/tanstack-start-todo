## TanStack Start Todo App with React
This is my hands-on experience with building a Todo application using TanStack Start app with React.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies with `pnpm install` command.
3. Run the application using `pnpm dev`.

The development app start on port number 3000. Good luck!
